Hi. I'm a starter theme called `_s`, or `underscores`, if you like. I'm a theme meant for hacking so don't use me as a Parent Theme. Instead try turning me into the next, most awesome, WordPress theme out there. That's what I'm here for.

My ultra-minimal CSS might make me look like theme tartare but that means less stuff to get in your way when you're designing your awesome theme. Here are some of the other more interesting things you'll find here:

_Herschel_ is named after Caroline Herschel, German astronomer, Honorary Member of the Royal Astronomical Society and the first woman to be paid for her work in astronomy. She truly was an awesome person go and read about her work and life: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caroline_Herschel
